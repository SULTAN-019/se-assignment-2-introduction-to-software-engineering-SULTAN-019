# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?Software ingineering applies scientific and mathematical principles to design,analysis and implementation of software systems while traditional programming is mainly concerned with writing code to solve specific problems 
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.`
requirments-is the gathering and documenting the user needs snd system requirememnts
Design-is the craeting high level and detail designs of the software architechture and user interface 
Implementation-writing code and building the softwareaccording to the design specification
Testing-conducting various tets to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
Deployment-releasing the software to users or customers
Maintenance-providing ongoing support ,updates and nhancements to the software after deployment 
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?waterfall is the sequential approach focused flowing downwards and its relevantly used to solve a short term projects while agile is the iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility,collaboration  and responding to change and it relevantly used to solve a long term project  
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.Requirments engineering is the area of systems engineering that deals with the process of dveloping and verifying the system requirements 
1;feasibility study-it concentrates on technical feasilbility,operationaland economic feasibility
2;Requirements Elicitation-It is related to the various ways used togain knowledge about the project domain and requirements.
3;Requirments Specification-is used to produce formal software requirements models 
4;Requirements verification and validation-verification refers to the set of tasks that ensures that the software correctly implements a specifiv function while validation refers to the set of tasks that ensure that the software that has been built is traceable to customer requirements.
5;Requirements management-is the process of analyzing,documenting,tracking,prioritizing and agreeing the requirements and controlling the communication with relevant stakeholders 

The importance of requirement engineering is that it ensures that the problem a client wants solved is clearly defined and the solution is both accurate and effective.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?mdoularity is the fundemental design principle in the softwr engineering aimed at creating software in a way that minimizes depencies among the components of the system.This helps to localize the impact of changes,simplifies maintenance and enhances the understandability of the system.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing)
1;Unit Tesing-errors are detected individually from every component or unit by individual testing the components 
2;Integration testing-is the testing two or more modules which are unit tested integrated to test  e.g technique interacting components 
3;System tseting-in this tseting,completed and integrated softwares are tested 
4;Acceptance testing-this kind of testing is conducted to ensure that the requiremments ofthe users are fulfilled before its delivery and that the siftware works correctly in the user's working environment 

. Why is testing crucial in software development?thorouh testing ensures conformance needs and technical specifications.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
Version control system manage changes to a set of files over time,particularly handy whentheses files are related to siftware development or scripting 
Examples of version control system include azureDevOPS server,AWS CodeCommit,Pnvalet,Git
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software project manger analyzes project constrain,establishes the projct objectives ,coordinate the project'sinternal and external teams construct project timelines and monitor the project's key performance indicators.
Challenges faced include mislignment between goals and business objectives,lack of accountability,resource allocation,scope creep,project management software and poor planning and unrealistic deadlines.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?Software maintenance is the proccess of changing,modifying and updating software to keep up with customer needs .
Software maintenance activities include corrective [fixing defects],adaptiv[adapting to the environment],pertective[enhancing attributes ]and preventive[preventing problems]
Software maintenance modifies and update software applications after deployments to fix bugs and improve system performance

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face?Ethical issues faced by software engineer include algorithmic bias,personal data collection,weak security protection and negative relationship between feature and impact.
 How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
 Software engineers assess the ethical implications of the software's purpose and funtionality,ensuring that it does not harm individuals or perpetuate discrimination.
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
